        //data types in Javascript.
        // 1. String data type

        //Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
        var a="Lets Upgrade"
        console.log(a) // this prints the string 

        //2. Number data type
        //Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
        var a= 1 //without decimal
        var b=1.1 // with decimal
        console.log('a=',a,'b=',b)

        //3. boolean
        //Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
        //Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
        var a=true
        console.log('a=',a)

        //4.undefined
        // a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
        var a;
        console.log('undefined=',a)

        //5.array
        //The Array object is used to store multiple values in a single variable:
        //arrays are written with square brackets.
        //Array items are separated by commas.
        var a=[1,2,3]
        console.log(a)

        //6.objects
        //objects are written with curly braces {}.
        //Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
        var a={a:1,b:2}
        console.log(a)
