    //difference between var, let and const

    // 1. var
    //The var statement declares a variable.
    //Variables are containers for storing information.
    //To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign 
    //and also we can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it
    var a=10
    var b=5
    console.log('using var=',a+b)
     
    //2.let
    //Variables declared with the let keyword can have Block Scope.
    //Variables declared inside a block {} cannot be accessed from outside the block:
    // it is used to assign the value to exsisting variable in side the block  without effecting the gloabal variable
    {
        let a=20
        console.log('using let=',a+b)
    }
     
    //3.const
    //Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned:
    //once the variable is assigned using const then we cannot assign again
    {const a=15
    console.log('using const=',a+b)   
    }
